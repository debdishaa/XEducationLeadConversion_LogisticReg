## Problem Statement

X Education receives many leads daily through its website and various marketing channels. However, the conversion rate is low. The company needs a model to assign a lead score to each lead, helping the sales team focus on leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.

## Goals

1. **Build a Logistic Regression Model**: Assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, indicating the likelihood of conversion.
2. **Adjust to Future Requirements**: Ensure the model can handle additional requirements presented by the company.

## Data

The dataset contains around 9000 records with attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable is 'Converted', indicating whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). The dataset also contains categorical variables with a 'Select' level, which needs to be handled appropriately.

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: A well-commented notebook with the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.
2. **Word Document**: Solutions to additional problems posed by the company.
3. **Presentation**: A concise presentation summarizing the problem statement, analysis approach, results, and recommendations, including visualizations.
4. **Summary Report**: A 500-word report detailing the approach, analysis, and learnings from the project.

## Expected Results

- A logistic regression model providing a lead score.
- Detailed analysis and recommendations presented in a clear and concise manner.
- Visualizations and summary of key results.
- A summary report explaining the methodology and insights gained.
